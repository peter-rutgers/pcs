From 1.12 to 1.13:

- Removed mpi and pth directories
- Added omp/fibo1 omp/fibo2 omp/fibo3 sources and buildrules

From 1.11 to 1.12:

- fix the package name/version in the seq/ sub-directory.

From 1.10 to 1.11:

- obsolete "PROJECTINFO". Suggest the use of "make dist
  distdir=...." to generate archives.

- fix / simplify the generation of data files.

- print the names of the input files being read.

- improve the documentation.

From 1.9 to 1.10:

- simplify the example implementation.

- improve the documentation.
	
From 1.8 to 1.9:

- make 'main' return 0.

- implement fixed boundary in example code.

From 1.7 to 1.8:

- change the cylinder wrap-around direction.

- introduce periodic reporting.

- put example implementation in non-distributable files.

- make data rules conditional on the availability of "convert".

- homogeneize the program target names.

- prepare Makefile targets for the ancillary assignments.

From 1.6 to 1.7:

- provide example implementation for plain sequential C.

- provide 'compute.h' then lay out the various implementations of
  'compute.c' and the corresponding Makefile.am's so that "make dist"
  works by default.

- provide "fill in the blank" compute.c for pth/, omp/ and mpi/

- add check for whether "-lm" is required or not.

From 1.5 to 1.6:

- separate build targets into 4 sub-directories ("seq", "pth",
  "mpi", "omp") since they need different configure scripts.

From 1.4 to 1.5:

- output.c: Document output. Fix FLOP/s computation.
  (Thanks to J. Teunissen).

From 1.3 to 1.4:

- input.c: Fix support for parameters `-H' and `-L'. They were
  documented but not recognized on the command line properly.

- data.mk: Fix formula for generating pattern 1. Add new patterns 2
  and 3, a uniform gray background and a gradient.

- ChangeLog: track list of changes for future versions.

From 1.2 to 1.3:

- input.h, input.c: Add support for `-p', used in assignment series 2.

From 1.1 to 1.2:

- output.h, output.c: Define `struct results' and use it.

- main.c, main_outputdemo.c: Use `struct results' here too.

- configure.ac, maint.mk: Use -f with `autoconf' to force regeneration
  of `configure' when version number changes.

- README: Update documentation.
